## ARRuler

ARRuler is an iOS app that allows you to measure anything in the real world. After you place two dots by tapping your screen representing
your start and endpoints, it will render the measurement (in inches) in cool 3D floating text.

Through developing this app, I gained and solidified knowledge in various learning topics, including...

* Advanced ARKit
* Detecting the start and endpoints of mesurements in the real-world.
* Creating 3D text in the AR Scene

## Installation & How to Run

To run this project, make sure you have Xcode on your machine and follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Open the project file in Xcode and click the "play" button in the Xcode toolbar (or you can use the keyboard shortcut Command-R.)
